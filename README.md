predict the median value of owner-occupied homes

The dataset you provided is the Boston Housing Dataset, which is a classic dataset used in machine learning and statistics for regression analysis. It contains data on housing in the Boston area and is often used to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (the MEDV column). Here's a breakdown of the columns and their meanings:

Column Descriptions:
CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town.

Higher values indicate a town with a higher crime rate.<br>
ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet.

Higher values mean the area is more residential with larger plots of land.
 The Proportion of Residential Land for Lots (ZN) refers to the percentage of land in an area that is specifically zoned for residential living, but with a particular focus on large lot sizes (lots larger than 25,000 square feet).
 <br>
INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

Indicates how much of the area is industrial or business-related.<br>
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds the river; 0 otherwise).

Whether the property is near the Charles River or not.<br>
NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).

Reflects air pollution levels; lower values are better.<br>
RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.

Indicates the size of houses; higher values mean larger homes.<br>
AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.

Higher values indicate older properties.<br>
DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.

Lower values mean closer proximity to job hubs.<br>
RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways.

A higher value suggests better highway accessibility.<br>
TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000.

Reflects the tax burden in a particular area.<br>
PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
which is a measure of the number of students per teacher in schools within a particular town.

A lower value is better, as it suggests smaller class sizes.
<br>
B: 1000(ùêµùëò‚àí0.63)^2, where Bk is the proportion of Black residents by town.

Sociodemographic indicator.
    <br>
LSTAT: Percentage of lower-status population.

Higher values indicate areas with lower-income residents.
    <br>
MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s. 

The MEDV (Median Value of Owner-Occupied Homes) column represents the median (not the average) value of homes that are owner-occupied in a particular area, measured in $1000s.
These are homes where the person living in the home is also the owner, rather than a tenant renting the property.
    
The target variable (dependent variable) you might want to predict in a regression task.
